# Airbnb Clone with Locofy and LocoAI

This project is an Airbnb clone web application developed following the "One-Click AI Web Development" tutorial from freeCodeCamp. The main objective was to explore the use of artificial intelligence to accelerate the web development process by converting Figma designs into functional code with a single click.

## Features

- **Conversion of Figma designs to frontend code**: Using the Locofy Lightning and LocoAI tools, the Figma designs of the application were converted into high-quality, production-ready React code.
- **User authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to access the application.
- **Property management**: Users can interact with property data in real-time.
- **Database integration**: A MongoDB database was integrated to store and retrieve application data.
- **Deployment on Netlify**: The application was deployed on Netlify, making it accessible online.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Tools**: Figma, Locofy Lightning, LocoAI
